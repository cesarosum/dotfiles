# dotfiles

Repository for my dotfiles. Because it will be cold day in day before I succumb to using VSCode.

## How to

Create a soft link from the location of where the config file normally lives to the location in the dotfile repo.

`ln -s <config-file-location> <~/dotfiles/<application>/<dotfile>>

## Applications

### tmux

Forked from awesome-vim.

TODO

  1. Install powerline fonts
  2. Update tmux.conf.local to use the powerline glyphs
  3. Use vim bindings for navigation 

### vim

Cobbled together from various friends and colleagues.

TODO

  1. Switch to vundle for package management.
  2. Install ale for linting and syntax fixes
